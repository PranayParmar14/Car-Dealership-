The Car Dealership Inventory Management System is a Python-based program designed to help car dealerships efficiently manage their inventory. The system allows dealership employees to add, remove, update, and display cars in stock using an interactive console-based approach.

The program consists of two primary classes:

Car Class: Represents individual cars, storing attributes such as maker, model, and price, along with getter methods to retrieve this information.

Dealer Class: Manages the dealershipâ€™s inventory, allowing users to add cars, remove specific models, update prices, and calculate the total inventory value.
The system features an interactive main function that prompts users for dealership details and provides menu-driven functionality to manage the inventory. The show_cars() method displays the current stock, while total_value() calculates the total worth of all cars in inventory.

This project demonstrates a strong understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP), user input handling, and dynamic data management within a structured Python application.

Technologies Used: Python 3.x, OOP, Console-Based UI
